CE network, named ce.txt, consists of 2745 nodes and 5851 edges.
DM network, named dm.txt, consists of 6709 nodes and 26712 edges.
The file "table.ce-dm.txt" is the homologous table between CE and DM, converted from ce-dm.evals.
The file "MIPS-CE.txt" contains all proteins in 'ce.txt',and 'CE-2745N' is the network name.

The file "yeast-human.txt" is the aligned result between Yeast and Human, obtained by HGA algorithm.

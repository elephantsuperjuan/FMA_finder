C. elegans and D. melanogaster networks are from http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/mna/isobase/#
(Reference:Chindelevitch, Leonid, Chung-Shou Liao, and Bonnie Berger. "Local optimization for global alignment of protein interaction networks." Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Vol. 15. 2010.).

CE network, named ce.txt, consists of 2745 nodes and 5851 edges.
DM network, named dm.txt, consists of 6709 nodes and 26712 edges.
The file "ce-dm.txt" is the aligned result between Yeast and Human, obtained by HGA algorithm.

The GO annotations of CE and DM network is get from Isobase (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/mna/isobase/#),
isobase-ceGOlist.json and isobase-dmGOlist.json are the json-formatted files of CE and DM networks' GO annotations respectively.
